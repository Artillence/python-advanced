    "Parallel programming is a technique to run multiple operations concurrently, thereby reducing the time to complete a task. Python offers several ways to achieve parallelism, including multiprocessing, multithreading, and asynchronous programming. In addition, libraries like CuPy, Numba, and cuDF can leverage GPU capabilities to further enhance performance.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **ThreadPoolExecutor**: We use `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module to manage a pool of threads. The `max_workers` parameter specifies the maximum number of threads that can be active at the same time. \n",

    "4. **Context Manager**: The `with` statement ensures that the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is properly cleaned up and closed after use.\n",

    "**Asyncio:**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Asyncio is a library used to write concurrent code using the `async`/`await` syntax. It is part of the Python standard library from Python 3.5+.\n",
    "- **Event Loop**: Central to asyncio, the event loop runs asynchronous tasks and callbacks, performs network IO operations, and runs subprocesses.\n",
    "- **Concurrency Model**: Cooperative multitasking, where tasks yield control back to the event loop at await points, allowing other tasks to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threads:**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Threads are a way to achieve concurrency by running multiple threads (smaller units of a process) in parallel. Python’s threading module provides high-level support for threads.\n",
    "- **Concurrency Model**: Pre-emptive multitasking, where the operating system decides when a thread is interrupted and another is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Programming Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asyncio:**\n",
    "- **Code Style**: Uses `async def` to declare asynchronous functions and `await` to yield control.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of coroutines and the event-driven programming model.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",

    "    asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threads:**\n",
    "- **Code Style**: Uses the `threading` module, creating threads by subclassing `Thread` or directly instantiating `Thread` objects.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Easier to grasp for those familiar with traditional multi-threading but requires careful handling of shared resources to avoid race conditions.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import threading, time\n",
    "\n",
    "    def worker():\n",
